# 🤖💳 AI Avatar Video Chat Payment System (Open Source MVP)

## 🚀 Vision

Create an open-source, AI-powered video chat system that enables users to complete payments through natural conversations with a lifelike avatar. Ideal for early-stage testing, demos, and hackathon proof-of-concepts.

---

## 🎯 Goal for MVP

Deliver a basic web app where a user:

1. Connects to a real-time video chat with an AI avatar
2. Speaks simple phrases ("I want to buy this")
3. Gets a payment link or modal via voice/chat
4. Completes payment using open-source tools

## 🧠 Use Cases

* Elderly-friendly ecommerce checkout
* Booking consultations (doctor, lawyer)
* Subscription upgrades
* Gift purchases

## 🛠️ Open Source Tech Stack

### Frontend

* `React.js` with `TypeScript`
* `WebRTC` via `simple-peer` for P2P video
* `TailwindCSS` for fast UI styling
* `Socket.IO` for signaling & real-time messages

### Avatar + AI

* `SadTalker` (for lip-sync avatar generation)
* `OpenAI Whisper` (for speech-to-text)
* `Open-source GPT model` (e.g. LM Studio, GPT4All)
* `Edge-TTS` or `Coqui TTS` (text-to-speech)

### Backend

* `Node.js` with `Express`
* `Razorpay` or `Stripe` for payments (can be mocked if needed)
* `Socket.IO` for signaling and messaging
* `MongoDB` or `JSON file` storage for user sessions

### Infrastructure

* `Docker` for containerization
* `Local deployment` or `Render/Vercel` for testing

## 🔐 Security (MVP Scope)

* No sensitive data stored
* Payment processed via secure Razorpay/Stripe links
* Encrypted WebRTC by default

---

## 🔄 Voice-to-Payment Flow (MVP)

1. User says: "I want to buy this."
2. Speech → Text (Whisper)
3. Text → GPT reply: "Great! Here’s a secure payment link."
4. Backend creates payment link
5. Frontend displays it inline or in chat
6. User completes payment
7. Webhook confirms, updates UI

## 📦 Future Enhancements

* Real-time talking avatar (MuseTalk)
* Memory across sessions
* Mobile app
* Face recognition & identity validation
* Payments via voice-only commands
